                   1. INTRODUCTION 
The core elements of a space shooter game in C include: 
Game Loop: The game uses a simple while-loop game loop where the program repeatedly 
processes input, updates the game state, and renders output each wave until the base health 
reaches zero and the game enters the GAME_OVER state 
Player Control: The player control used to run the game is 
 Pressing Enter to start the game from the menu 
 Typing a number (0, 1, or 2) and pressing Enter to choose whether to build a tower or skip 
during each wave 
So, the player controls the game by entering numeric choices through the keyboard using scanf 
and getchar 
Objects and Variables: The game uses Tower and Enemy objects (structures) to represent 
defence and attackers, and variables such as state, wave, money, baseHealth, base Enemy Health, 
and tower Count to control the game flow, progression, and player resources. 
Rendering: is done by printing the current game information to the console, specifically 
displaying the wave number, player money, and base health using printf 
Console I/O: Simple text-based representation within the console window. 
Collision Detection: This game does not implement collision detection, because enemies and 
towers are not positioned in a coordinate system; instead, all tower damage is applied directly to 
all enemies each wave without checking positions  
Game State Management: The game manages its state using the Game State num (MENU, 
PLAYING, GAME_OVER) and a variable state that controls which part of the game loop runs, 
allowing the program to switch between showing the menu, playing the game, and ending the game 
when the base health reaches zero.
